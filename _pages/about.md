Welcome to my personal website!
=====

Ciao! I'm Valentina. I am a PhD candidate in Indo-European Studies at UCLA, working under the supervision of <a href='https://pies.ucla.edu/person/brent-vine/'>Prof. Brent Vine</a> and <a href='https://davidgoldstein.netlify.app/'>Prof. David Goldstein</a>. My dissertation explores how language technology, quantitative methods, and computational approaches can shed light on processes of lexical change in Latin, with a particular focus on the changes brought about by the spread of Christianity.

During the 2024-25 academic year, I was a visiting PhD student in the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London, where I worked with <a href='https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/barbara-mcgillivray'>Dr. Barbara McGillivray</a> on embedding approaches to lexical semantic change detection.

More broadly, my interests lie in the sociolinguistic and contact phenomena related to the Indo-European language family, especially within the Italic and Celtic branches, as well as the integration of quantitative, statistical, computational, and corpus-based methods into historical linguistics. While I consider myself a historical linguist, I also enjoy engaging with theoretical linguistics. I have been interested in syntactic theory, in particular issues of agreement and referential hierarchies, but I will prick up my ears at other areas of linguistics as well.

Before coming to UCLA, I earned an MPhil in Classics from the University of Cambridge, where I specialized in Classical and Comparative Philology and Linguistics, and a BASc degree from University College London.
