Welcome to my personal website!
=====

Ciao! I'm Valentina. I am a PhD candidate in Indo-European Studies at UCLA, working under the supervision of <a href='https://pies.ucla.edu/person/brent-vine/'>Prof. Brent Vine</a> and <a href='https://davidgoldstein.netlify.app/'>Prof. David Goldstein</a>. My most recent work focuses on the implementation of language technology for the study of semantic change in Latin. Take a look around to find out about my academic pursuits.
